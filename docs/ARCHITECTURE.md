# Architecture

## Current scaffold architecture

The current repository is one private TypeScript ESM package:

- `src/cli.ts` is the real, thin `observe` command entry point (argument
  parsing/output only).
- `src/index.ts` is the library entry point re-exporting the observer-owned
  contracts/functions from every layer below.
- `scripts/clean.mjs` safely removes only the project `dist/` directory.
- `scripts/check-docs.mjs` validates the canonical documentation foundation,
  roadmap version presence, and the no-batches rule.
- TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest, and package configuration provide foundation
  validation, now exercised by real product tests (`tests/unit/`,
  `tests/browser/`).

Batch 1 added the observation domain/schema and safety-policy layer
(`src/domain/`, `src/request/`, `src/safety/`). Batch 2 added a real
Playwright Chromium browser adapter (`src/browser/`), a minimal application
seam invoking it (`src/application/`), and a deterministic browser
fixture/test boundary (`tests/fixtures/`, `tests/browser/`, run via
`npm run test:browser`). Batch 3 extended that single browser adapter with an
internal page/target measurement module (`src/browser/evidenceCapture.ts`)
that reads page and explicit-CSS-target evidence from the same live,
already-ready page used for the screenshot - no second browser/page is ever
opened, and Playwright objects still never leave `src/browser/`. Batch 4
added the artifact ownership boundary itself: `src/artifacts/artifactWriter.ts`
is the one canonical place that writes an observation to disk (temp
directory, then one atomic rename into `<outputLocation>/<observationId>/`),
and `src/application/observationPersistence.ts` assembles the frozen
`ObservationArtifact` from a browser-capture result before handing it to the
writer. The artifact layer has no Playwright dependency and is testable
without launching Chromium. Batch 5 completed the boundary chain: `src/cli.ts`
parses `observe` arguments (CLI-syntax errors only - e.g. malformed
`WIDTHxHEIGHT`), constructs a raw request, and hands it to the existing
Batch 1 `normalizeRequest`; on success it calls one new application-level use
case, `observe()` in `src/application/observationPersistence.ts`, which runs
the existing `runBrowserCapture` exactly once and, only on success, the
existing artifact writer exactly once, then returns a small observer-owned
`ApplicationObservationResult` (observation id, completion state, artifact
path, target/diagnostic counts) for the CLI to print. The CLI never imports
Playwright or the filesystem-write path directly. Batch 6 closed the
remaining real-Chromium coverage gap (a genuine navigation failure, distinct
from a readiness timeout or a pre-launch safety rejection) and validated the
packed npm tarball end to end in a clean consumer environment, independent
of the source checkout. There is still no controlled-scroll/comparison
behavior.

## Planned v0.1 architecture constraints

v0.1 planning must preserve these approved boundaries without treating module
names from the historical run as mandatory:

```text
thin command-line boundary
        ↓
reusable observation engine/application layer
        ↓
browser automation boundary
        ↓
observer-owned runtime evidence

observer-owned domain/schema
        ↓
artifact ownership boundary

deterministic fixture/test boundary
        ↓
browser-level validation
```

Use one browser engine implementation, keep browser logic out of presentation,
avoid speculative plugin/multi-browser abstractions, and keep observed
applications external. Before v0.6, versions must not add runtime coupling to
sibling ecosystem projects. v0.6 may add only explicit bounded context,
correlation/export, orchestrator-consumption, and lab-compatibility contracts
while preserving independent ownership.

The text/config-driven coding-agent workflow must be operational before the
viewer and annotation layers are added. Those interfaces consume the same
canonical observation, relationship, comparison, contract, change-scope,
correlation, and context boundaries rather than creating parallel engines.
The concrete implementation plan and module layout must be designed only after
the relevant version planning workflow inspects the current repositories.
